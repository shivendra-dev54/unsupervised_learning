# unsupervised learning projects
 These are the projects I've created while learning ML.
 These projects are helpful to understand the basic working of ML algorithms and math behind them.


## This Repository include following unsupervised learning projects

    1. K-means clustering
        - Customer segmentation

    2. Hierarchical Clustering
        - market basket analysis

    3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - gene expression (reducing features)

    4. t-SNE & UMAP
        - anomaly detection on network traffic

    5. DBSCAN
